# this code sets up a basic Flask application that listens for requests on the root URL ("/") and responds by rendering an HTML template called "index.html". The application is run in debug mode, which allows for easier development and troubleshooting

# To run this application, you would need to have Flask installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
# pip install Flask
